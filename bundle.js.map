The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link ol.Map} has a `target` property, accessed with `getTarget()`  and\n * changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however settable. There\n * are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For example,\n * `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link ol.View} has a `center`\n * property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would call the\n * function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within the\n * function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()` would\n * return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link ol.Object#getProperties object.getProperties()}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An `ol.View` has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But an `ol.View` object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * @constructor\n * @extends {ol.Object}\n * @param {olx.ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n * @api\n */\nvar _ol_View_ = function(opt_options) {\n  __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__object__[\"a\" /* default */].call(this);\n\n  var options = __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_16__obj__[\"a\" /* default */].assign({}, opt_options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>}\n   */\n  this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<Array.<ol.ViewAnimation>>}\n   */\n  this.animations_ = [];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number|undefined}\n   */\n  this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n  this.updateAnimations_ = this.updateAnimations_.bind(this);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @const\n   * @type {ol.proj.Projection}\n   */\n  this.projection_ = __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_17__proj__[\"a\" /* default */].createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n  this.applyOptions_(options);\n};\n\n__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__index__[\"a\" /* default */].inherits(_ol_View_, __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__object__[\"a\" /* default */]);\n\n\n/**\n * Set up the view with the given options.\n * @param {olx.ViewOptions} options View options.\n */\n_ol_View_.prototype.applyOptions_ = function(options) {\n\n  /**\n   * @type {Object.<string, *>}\n   */\n  var properties = {};\n  properties[__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_7__viewproperty__[\"a\" /* default */].CENTER] = options.center !== undefined ?\n      options.center : null;\n\n  var resolutionConstraintInfo = _ol_View_.createResolutionConstraint_(\n      options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>|undefined}\n   */\n  this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n  var centerConstraint = _ol_View_.createCenterConstraint_(options);\n  var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n  var rotationConstraint = _ol_View_.createRotationConstraint_(options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {ol.Constraints}\n   */\n  this.constraints_ = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__constraints__[\"a\" /* default */](\n      centerConstraint, resolutionConstraint, rotationConstraint);\n\n  if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n    properties[__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_7__viewproperty__[\"a\" /* default */].RESOLUTION] = options.resolution;\n  } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n    properties[__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_7__viewproperty__[\"a\" /* default */].RESOLUTION] = this.constrainResolution(\n        this.maxResolution_, options.zoom - this.minZoom_);\n  }\n  properties[__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_7__viewproperty__[\"a\" /* default */].ROTATION] =\n      options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0;\n  this.setProperties(properties);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {olx.ViewOptions}\n   */\n  this.options_ = options;\n\n};\n\n/**\n * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An `ol.View` has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But an `ol.View` object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * @constructor\n * @extends {ol.Object}\n * @param {olx.ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n * @api\n */\nvar _ol_View_ = function(opt_options) {\n  _ol_Object_.call(this);\n\n  var options = _ol_obj_.assign({}, opt_options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>}\n   */\n  this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<Array.<ol.ViewAnimation>>}\n   */\n  this.animations_ = [];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number|undefined}\n   */\n  this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n  this.updateAnimations_ = this.updateAnimations_.bind(this);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @const\n   * @type {ol.proj.Projection}\n   */\n  this.projection_ = _ol_proj_.createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n  this.applyOptions_(options);\n};\n\n_ol_.inherits(_ol_View_, _ol_Object_);\n\n\n/**\n * Set up the view with the given options.\n * @param {olx.ViewOptions} options View options.\n */\n_ol_View_.prototype.applyOptions_ = function(options) {\n\n  /**\n   * @type {Object.<string, *>}\n   */\n  var properties = {};\n  properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.CENTER] = options.center !== undefined ?\n      options.center : null;\n\n  var resolutionConstraintInfo = _ol_View_.createResolutionConstraint_(\n      options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>|undefined}\n   */\n  this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n  var centerConstraint = _ol_View_.createCenterConstraint_(options);\n  var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n  var rotationConstraint = _ol_View_.createRotationConstraint_(options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {ol.Constraints}\n   */\n  this.constraints_ = new _ol_Constraints_(\n      centerConstraint, resolutionConstraint, rotationConstraint);\n\n  if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n    properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = options.resolution;\n  } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n    properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = this.constrainResolution(\n        this.maxResolution_, options.zoom - this.minZoom_);\n  }\n  properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.ROTATION] =\n      options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0;\n  this.setProperties(properties);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {olx.ViewOptions}\n   */\n  this.options_ = options;\n\n};\n\n/**\n * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.
